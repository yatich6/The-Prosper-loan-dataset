# Defaulted Loans Characterictics
 
## by Brian Yatich


## Dataset

>The Prosper loan dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan status, loan amount, borrower rate, borrower income range, among others . I performed changing of some data to categorical data in order to display some categories clearly. I also renamed some columns to make them more clear to understand.


## Summary of Findings

> The loan term with the most loan defaults was 36 months. This was also consistent thoughout most of the income ranges thoughout the data set. Most of the defaulted loans had the loan purpose as debt consolidation. However, the loan purpose with the highest average interest rates was the 'Tax'. The loan purpose with the lowest interest rate was 'personal use'.

>The income range of between $25,000-49,000 had the most loan default frequency. Under further scrutiny, it was observed that this was due to the fact that this range of income had the highest interest rate on their loans.I also observed that loan amounts within the range of $0 - 5000 had the highest rate of defaults and this was because this loan range had the highest average interest rates. Also, Loan defaulters with a monthly income range of between $0-10,000 had the highest frequency of defaults. A general decrease in loan defaults was seen with an increase in monthly income.

>The heatmap showed the strongest correlation being between monthly loan payments and loan amounts. A general positive correlation, or rather an increase in the amount of monthly payments with an increase in the loan amounts 
> It was also observed that the interest rates of defaulted loans increased with a decrease in the loan prosper rating. Generally, lower prosper ratings resulted in higher loan interest rates


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Generally, the factors that influence loan defaults mainly include interest rate, loan amount, monthly income and monthly payments. Increased interest rates tend to cause higher loan defaults.
